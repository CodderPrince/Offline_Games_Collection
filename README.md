## ⚙️ How the Application Works

* **User Login & Account Creation:** On launch, users enter their name and age. Existing users can login; new users can create accounts instantly.
* **Game Selection Screen:** After login, users see a two-column list of available games. Each game is presented as a stylish animated button.
* **Launching Games:** Clicking a game button opens the corresponding JavaFX window for that game.
* **Leaderboard Updates:** After playing a game, scores are recorded and saved locally with timestamps and user info.
* **Leaderboard View & Management:** Users can view the leaderboard with sorted scores, and reset it if desired.
* **All data** (users, scores) is persisted in local files to maintain progress offline.
